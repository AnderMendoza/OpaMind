### Built with

For the elaboration of this project we have used different tools which have been observed in the course of the race, where we had to use these in our own way both in the design and in the functionalities, of which the Flutter SDK was used to develop user interfaces for our application on Android, iOS and Web. Dart was used as a programming language, the latter two created by Google. And for our emulator we use Android Studio to be able to visualize the changes in real time. Also note that we added the Firebase service as an extra for the authentication of our users when logging in.
